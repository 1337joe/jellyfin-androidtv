# TODO

  - Adding a server does not refresh the server list (need to restart activity)
  - Profile pictures not showing (FUTURE PR)
  - Profile pictures not cached (FUTURE PR)
  - Add old credential migration and remove as sources in ServersRepo
  - Use consistent naming for:
    - user/account
    - login/authenticate
    - address/url
    etc
  - Add "Id" suffix to parameters/variables that hold the id of an entity
    - serverId
    - userId
  - Test with CBOR instead of JSON and determine if file size reduction is worth it
